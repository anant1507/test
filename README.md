Project Description - Eco-Rakshak by Team ETHIX

Eco-Rakshak is an AI-powered smart waste management system designed to revolutionize waste segregation and disposal. Our solution leverages computer vision (YOLOv3) to detect and classify waste into biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and chemical categories in real-time.

Key Features:
Smart Waste Detection

Uses AI object detection to identify waste items from live camera feed.

Auto-classifies waste into three bins with 90%+ accuracy.

Bin Monitoring & Alerts

Tracks fill-levels of each dustbin.

Sends email notifications to authorities when bins reach capacity.

Interactive Dashboard

Real-time camera feed with toggle controls (exposure/contrast/flip).

Detection toggle to enable/disable AI classification.

User-Friendly Interface

Intuitive controls for camera adjustments.

Visual indicators for bin status (green/blue/red).

Chatbot Assistant

AI-powered chatbot to guide users on waste disposal.

Automated Notifications

Alerts maintenance teams via SMTP emails when bins overflow.

Team ETHIX (Anantveer, Gaganjot, Amanjot, Sakshi) developed this system to reduce manual errors in waste sorting and promote eco-friendly practices. Built with Python, Flask, YOLOv3, and JavaScript, Eco-Rakshak ensures efficient, automated waste management for smarter cities.
